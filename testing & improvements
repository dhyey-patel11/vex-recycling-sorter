# Test Results

## Summary
- Trials: 40
- Correct sorts: 34
- Accuracy: 85%

## Conditions Tested
- Lighting: normal room light, bright light
- Conveyor speed: low / medium
- Cap placement: centered / off-center

## Failure Modes Observed
- Misread when cap entered at an angle
- Reflectivity overlap on scratched caps
- Sensor drift under strong ambient light

## Improvements Made
Ambient light caused inconsistent readings → added shade + adjusted LED settings”
Sensor delay caused misclassification at high speed → tuned conveyor speed”
Two caps on belt caused jams → enforced single-cap processing”
